Go placidly amid the noise and waste,
And remember what comfort there may be in owning a piece thereof.
Avoid quiet and passive persons, unless you are in need of sleep.
Rotate your tires.
Speak glowingly of those greater than yourself,
And heed well their advice -- even though they be turkeys.
Know what to kiss -- and when.
Remember that two wrongs never make a right,
But that three do.
Wherever possible, put people on `HOLD'.
Be comforted, that in the face of all aridity and disillusionment,
And despite the changing fortunes of time,
There is always a big future in computer maintenance.

Frobnicate, v.: To manipulate or adjust, to tweak.  Derived from
FROBNITZ.  Usually abbreviated to FROB.  Thus one has the saying "to
frob a frob".  See TWEAK and TWIDDLE.  Usage: FROB, TWIDDLE, and TWEAK
sometimes connote points along a continuum.  FROB connotes aimless
manipulation; TWIDDLE connotes gross manipulation, often a coarse
search for a proper setting; TWEAK connotes fine-tuning.  If someone is
turning a knob on an oscilloscope, then if he's carefully adjusting it
he is probably tweaking it; if he is just turning it but looking at the
screen he is probably twiddling it; but if he's just doing it because
turning a knob is fun, he's frobbing it.

Human thought itself, in its unprecedented guise as computer software,
is becoming something to be crystallized, replicated, made a commodity.
Even the insides of our brains aren't sacred; on the contrary, the human
brain is a primary target of increasingly successful research,
ontological and spiritual questions be damned.  The idea that, under
these circumstances, Human Nature is somehow destined to prevail against
the Great Machine, is simply silly; it seems weirdly beside the point.
It's as if a rodent philosopher in a lab-cage, about to have his brain
bored and wired for the edification of Big Science, were to piously
declare that in the end Rodent Nature must triumph.

about whose profession was the oldest.  In the course of their

Eve was made from Adam's rib, as the story goes, and that was a simply
incredible surgical feat."
	The architect did not agree.  He said, "But if you look at the
Garden itself, in the beginning there was chaos and void, and out of
that, the Garden and the world were created.  So God must have been an
architect."

Of all the classes of men, I dislike the most those who make their
livings by talking--actors, clergymen, politicians, pedagogues, and so
on.  All of them participate in the shallow false pretenses of the
actor who is their archetype.  It is almost impossible to imagine a
talker who sticks to the facts.  Carried away by the sound of his own
voice and the applause of the groundlings, he makes inevitably the
jump from logic to mere rhetoric.  His success is judged by the favor
of his inferiors, or at all events of persons supposed to be his
inferiors, and for that sort of thing I have no taste.  If he is
intelligent at all, which happens occasionally, he must be well aware
that this favor is irrational and almost certainly transient.  He is
admired for his worst qualities, and he cannot count upon being
admired for long.  A good part of my time, in my earlier days, was
spent listening to speeches of one sort or another, and to watching
their makers glow under the ensuing clapper- clawing.  I was always
sorry for such men, for I soon observed that the applause of today was
almost invariably followed by the indifference of tomorrow.

If a machine is not too bright and incapable of reflection, it does
whatever you tell it to do.  But a smart machine will first consider
which is more worth its while: to perform the given task or, instead,
to figure some way out of it.  Whichever is easier. And why indeed
should it behave otherwise, being truly intelligent?  For true
intelligence demands choice, internal freedom.  And therefore we have
the malingerants, fudgerators and drudge-dodgers, not to mention the
special phenomenon of simulimbecility or mimicretinism.  A mimicretin

With one stroke of his fifty-pound sword, Gnorts the Barbarian lopped
off the head of Nialliv the Wizard. It flew through the air, still
sneering, while Gnorts clove two royal guardsmen from vizor through
breasplate to steel jockstrap. As he whirled to escape, an arrow glanced
off his own chainmail. Then he was gone from the room, into the midnight
city. Easily outrunning pursuit, he took a few sentries at the gate by
surprise. For a moment, arms and legs hailed around him through showers
of blood; then he had opened the gate and was free. A caravan of
merchants, waiting to enter at dawn, was camped nearby. Seeing a
magnificent stallion tethered, Gnorts released it, twisted the rope into
a bridle, and rode it off bareback. After galloping several miles, he
encountered a mounted patrol that challenged him. Immediately he plunged
into the thick of the cavalrymen, swinging his blade right and left with
deadly effect, rearing up his steed to bring its forefeet against one
knight who dared to confront him directly. Then it was only to gallop
onward. Winter winds lashed his body, attired in nothing more than a
bearskin kilt, but he ignored the cold. Sunrise revealed the shore and
his waiting longship. He knew the swift-sailing craft could bring him
across five hundred leagues of monster-infested ocean in time for him to
snatch the maiden princess Elamef away from evil Baron Rehcel while she
remained a maiden---not that he intended to leave her in that
condition....

I helped make Mexico safe for American oil interests in 1914. I helped
make Haiti and Cuba a decent place for the National City Bank boys to
collect revenue in. I helped purify Nicaragua for the international

nontestimony by a nonexpert, which was followed by a nondefeat.

This is, perhaps, the most fundamental lesson of our study:
ordinary people, simply doing their jobs, and without any particular
hostility on their part, can become agents in a terrible destructive
process.  Moreover, even when the destructive effects of their work
become patently clear, and they are asked to carry out actions
incompatible with fundamental standards of morality, relatively few
people have the resources needed to resist authority.  A variety of
inhibitions against disobeying authority come into play and successfully
keep the person in his place.

Come, let us hasten to a higher plane,
Where dyads tread the fairy fields of Venn,
Their indices bedecked from one to _n,
Commingled in an endless Markov chain!

And every vector dreams of matrices.
Hark to the gentle gradient of the breeze:
It whispers of a more ergodic zone.

Let superscripts and subscripts go their ways.
Our symptotes no longer out of phase,
We shall encounter, counting, face to face.

I'll grant the random access to my heart,
Thoul't tell me all the constants of thy love;
And so we two shall all love's lemmas prove
And in our bound partition never part.

Cancel me not -- for what then shall remain?

A root or two, a torus and a node:
The inverse of my verse, a null domain.

I hear the tender tensor in thy sigh.

Had he but known such _a-squared cos 2(thi)!

There is a new definition of atheism not found among the current
orthodox: it is the non-experience of deity. It is not anti-theist, it
is supportive of the natural quest for meaning in myth, symbol and
practice, and challenges any construct that places itself in the
position of worship or unquestioning obedience, whether it be called
deity or law. Atheism is substantiated by the experience of no-god, or
the lack of experience, not by belief or rational counter-arguments to
theism. This definition comes, in part, from Pascal who conceives of a
person so made that s/he cannot believe - a person who by nature is
experientially limited to atheism.

Sermon to Dismount

and I say unto you
thou hast exceeded the lord's mandate
you have multiplied
but no longer are you fruitful
the earth you consume and pollute
with your numbers

so many
that it is unseemly for the lord
to walk among your camps
it is more than can be buried
it is more than can be burned
and you have despoiled a world
that formerly enticed the visit of angels
now the stink of excess rises
even to the courtyards of heaven

and the lord said
i have given unto you dominion
over the fish of the sea
and the birds of the air
over everything that moves
upon the earth
why then do you torture them
and press them into extinction
is this how you manage your vassals
would you have me rule my subjects
with as much indifference

and you say
who am i to speak on 
the behalf of the lord
i am a son of abraham
the nephew of moses
the brother of jesus
have you not always accepted
the commandments of the lord
from reluctant messengers
born among the jews

now or a little later.  But later on, in truth, it will be even harder,
and so the sooner the better.  I no longer have any property
whatsoever.  For me those I love have died, and for them I have died.
From today on, my body is useless and alien to me.  Only my spirit and
my conscience remain precious and important to me."

First, nothing in biology contradicts the laws of physics and chemistry;
any adequate biology must be consonant with the ``basic'' sciences.
Second, the principles of physics and chemistry are not sufficient to
explain complex biological objects because new properties emerge as a
result of organization and interaction.  These properties can only be
understood by the direct study of whole, living systems in their normal
state.  Third, the sufficiency of physics and chemistry to encompass
life records no mystical addition, no contradiction to the basic
sciences, but only reflects the hierarchy of natural objects and their
principle of emergent properties at higher levels of organization.

_Critical note_.--Of a piece with the absurd pedagogical demand for
so-called constructive criticism is the doctrine that an iconoclast is
a hollow and evil fellow unless he can prove his case. Why, indeed,
should he prove it?  Is he judge, jury, prosecuting officer, hangman? 
He proves enough, indeed, when he proves by his blasphemy that this
or that idol is defectively convincing--that at least _one_ visitor to
the shrine is left full of doubts. The fact is enormously significant; it
indicates that instinct has somehow risen superior to the shallowness
of logic, the refuge of fools. The pedant and the priest have always
been the most expert of logicians--and the most diligent disseminators
of nonsense and worse. The liberation of the human mind has never
been furthered by such learned dunderheads; it has been furthered by
gay fellows who heaved dead cats into sanctuaries and then went
roistering down the highways of the world, proving to all men that
doubt, after all, was safe--that the god in the sanctuary was finite in
his power, and hence a fraud. One horse-laugh is worth ten thousand
syllogisms. It is not only more effective; it is also vastly more
intelligent.

                   THE Y2K SONG
        Sung to the tune of "Gilligan's Island":

        Just sit right back and you'll hear a tale
        Of the doom that is our fate,
        That started when programmers used
        Two digits for a date,
        Two digits for a date.

        Main memory was smaller then;
        Hard disks were smaller, too.
        "Four digits are extravagant,
        So let's get by with two,
        So let's get by with two."

        "This works through 1999,"
        The programmers did say.
        "Unless we rewrite before that
        It all will go away,
        It all will go away."

        But management had not a clue:
        "It works fine now, you bet!
        A rewrite is a straight expense;
        We won't do it just yet,
        We won't do it just yet."

        Now when two thousand rolls around
        It all goes straight to h#ll,
        For zero's less than ninety-nine,
        As anyone can tell,

        The problems we're about to face
        Are fright-e-ning, for sure.
        And reading every line of code's
        The only certain cure,
        The only certain cure.

        There's not much time, there's too much code,
        (And COBOL-coders, few).
        When the century's finished with,
        We may be finished, too,
        We may be finished, too.

        The way to get the time we need
         I now propose to you:
        A Daylight Savings decade,
        Or maybe even two,
        Or maybe even two.

        Eight thousand years from now I hope
        That things weren't left too late,
        And people aren't lamenting

Everybody ought to agree that, given sufficient evidence for some
hypothesis about humans, we should accept that hypothesis whatever its
political implications.  But the question of what counts as sufficient
evidence is not independent of the political consequences.  If the costs
of being wrong are sufficiently high, then it is reasonable and
responsible to ask for more evidence than is demanded in situations
where mistakes are relatively innocuous.

"first ode to coffee"

examples of stone age men
enduring the rain
huddled under a granite cornice
waiting for a bus
essentially no genetic change
since cro-magnon

behind a fogged window
i eat a donut and chant
ward off sleep o tiny beans
from high colombian mountains
ground and brewed
sipped to focus ones thoughts

observe the swirling milky way
dissolve into a homogeneous blend
of brown coffee spinning slower
growing colder in my cup how was it
i believed that shifting a stone
on a beach altered destiny

does it matter that
you are reading this
that i am to join those
stone age victims of the weather
aristotle another cup
before i go

Science is much closer to myth than a scientific philosophy is prepared
to admit.  It is one of the many forms of thought that have been
developed by man, and not necessarily the best.  It is conspicuous,
noisy, and impudent, but it is inherently superior only for those who
have already decided in favor of a certain ideology, or who have
accepted it without ever having examined its advantages and its limits.
And as the accepting and rejecting of ideologies should be left to the
individual it follows that the separation of state and church must be
complemented by the separation of state and science, that most recent,
most aggressive, and most dogmatic religious institution.  Such a
separation may be our only chance to achieve a humanity we are capable
of, but have never fully realized.

Everyone knows that dragons don't exist.  But while this simplistic

False is the idea of utility that sacrifices a thousand real advan-
tages for one imaginary or trifling inconvenience; that would take
fire from men because it burns, and water because one may drown in
it; that has no remedy for evils, except destruction.  The laws that
forbid the carrying of arms are laws of such a nature.  They disarm 
those only who are neither inclined nor determined to commit crimes.
...  Such laws make things worse for the assaulted and better for 
the assailants; they serve rather to encourage than to prevent 
homicide, for an unarmed man may be attacked with greater confidence 
than an armed man.  They ought to be designated as laws not preven-
tive but fearful of crimes, produced by the tumultuous impression 
of a few isolated facts, and not by thoughtful consideration
of the inconveniences and advantages of a universal decree.

I remember Science. It showed up sometime in the 1950's and lingered,
really, into the late 70's before it disappeared in favor of
Information.  Science seemed made of tile and glass and was sheathed in
white cotton, smelling of alcohol. For a while in the 50's and 60's it
floated around the world in the company of suborbital monkeys and
Russians in tight-fitting aviator leather and then (finally!)  boys from
Ohio, done up in science-white suits, tramping firmly on the moon in
silver boots. Information seems made of gas, constantly expanding,
seemingly uncontainable, like the helium of the Hindenberg or the lost
balloons of children at zoos. Information shares Science's urgent need
for continuous extension and storage of the record but it isn't clear at
all whether the record must really any longer be consulted.

``Because great minds think a lot''
##
In recent decades we have passed, like Alice slipping through the
looking glass, into a new world.  This postmodern world looks and feels
in many ways like the modern world that preceded it: we still have the
belief systems that gave form to the modern world, and indeed we also
have remnants of many of the belief systems of premodern societies.  If
there is anything we have plenty of, it is belief systems.  But we also
have something else: a growing suspicion that all belief systems---all
ideas about human reality---are social constructions.  This is a story
about stories, a belief about beliefs, and in time---probably a very
short time---it will become a central part of the worldview of most
people.  It will be the core of the first global civilization.

One:   State a Tautology then ring the changes on its corallaries;
       that's philosophy

Two:   Imagine spirits concerned with your welfare; that's religion.

Three: Record many facts.  Try to see a pattern.  Then make a wrong
       guess at the next fact;  that's science.

Four:  Awareness that you live in a malevolent universe controlled
       by Murphy's Law:  that's programming.

                        OZYMANDIAS

           I met a traveller from an antique land
       Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone
       Stand in the desert ... Near them, on the sand,
       Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,
         And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,
      Tell that its a sculptor well those passions read
     Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
      The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:
           And on the pedestal these words appear:
          ``My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:
         Look on my words, ye Mightly, and despair!''
          Nothing beside remains.  Round the decay
         Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare
         The lone and level sands stretch far away.

...but as records of courts and justice are admissible, it can
easily be proved that powerful and malevolent magicians once existed

on it were sound in logic and in law.  Nothing in any existing court
was ever more thoroughly proved than the charges of witchcraft and
sorcery for which so many suffered death.  If there were no witches,
human testimony and human reason are alike destitute of value.

This has been the main effect of skepticism in the world, working over
long ages:  that it has become _gauche_ and embarassing to admit certain
indubitable facts.  Their unpopularity is due not to their destruction or
abandonment but simply to the forensic talent of the skeptics, a bombastic
and tyrannical sect of men, with a great deal of cruelty concealed in their
so-called love of truth.  It is not altruism that moves them to their
assaults upon what other men hold to be precious; it is something no more
than a yearning to make those other men leap.  The fundamentalists of
Tennessee are thus right in denouncing Clarence Darrow.  Mr. Darrow, I have
no doubt, loves the truth -- but it is with a passion comparable to that a
man has for an amiable maiden aunt.  When he went to Tennessee he went on

Ah, purity
And the purists,
Talking,
Talking of hearts that are pure
And an art that is pure
And an earth that is not at the moment but should be
Some day
Pure.

Talking, talking,
Talking in what would appear to be total ignorance
Of the following simple, pure fact about purity: purity
Is as rare in its purest state
As the absolute vacuum
Of which the physicist speaks in his classroom when somebody
Knowing too much suggests that all falling bodies
Do not fall equally fast.
``But they would,'' the physicist says, ``they would if you took
All the air away.''

                  All the air away?
Who would take all the air away?  Is there anyone,
Anyone present, anyone living,
Who would make such an issue of purity that he'd take
All the air away?
I must meet him.
I must shake his pure white hand and say to him, ``Blast!
If you take all the air away, you'll fall equally fast.''

        -- Reed Whittemore, 1956

For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading
edge, could be so useless, and then it occurred to me that a computer is
a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart things, while
computer programmers are smart people with the ability to do incredibly

You don't have to belong to one of the six talking professions to cause
mischief, but it helps.  There is indeed a "New Class" of opinion
leaders distinguished by their ability to manipulate words. They can be
grouped into the six talking professions---politicians, educators,
journalists, lawyers (!), theologians, and entertainers. All have their
place, but they also happen to be: Sheltered from the real world, rarely
exposed to the consequences of their ideas, and intent on concerning
themselves with other people's business. Thus, they're in a position to
cause great mischief---and do.

When was this meeting where they voted out existential humanism, and
voted in pomo?  Why wasn't I invited?  Isn't pomo really one big
cover-up for for the failure of the French to write a truly interesting
novel ever since a sports car ate Albert Camus?  Without gravity, can
there be any grace?  Instead of sitting around being *valorized* by
pomo, why aren't the punks out there doing something about the ownership
of the modes of production by Bell Atlantic, Liberty Media, Viacom,
Nynex, Paramount, Barry Diller and Si Newhouse?  Have any of these
people, pomo or punk, during downtime, ever read *Beloved* or
*Midnight's Children* or *One Hundred Years of Solitude*, spent a night
as a volunteer in a homeless shelter, worked with AIDS patients, stopped
a troop train or a lynching, . . . *engaged* what's really out there

A corporation, essentially, is a pile of money to which a number of
persons have sold their moral allegiance.  As such, unlike a person, a
corporation does not age.  It does not arrive, as most persons finally
do, at a realization of the shortness and smallness of human lives; it
does not come to see the future as the lifetimes of the children and
grandchildren of anybody in particular.  It can experience no personal
hope or remorse, no change of heart.  It cannot humble itself.  It goes
about its business as if it were immortal, with the single purpose of
becoming a bigger pile of money.

If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds

   Security Notes from All Over: The Odyssey

Polyphemus's one eye is a single point of failure; when Odysseus pokes
it out, he is much less able to defend himself.  Polyphemus's alarm is
ignored because Odysseus said his name was Nobody, so he winds up
shouting that nobody is trying to kill him (you'd think the other
Cyclopes would come see what's going on, but maybe Polyphemus shouts
random stupid things all the time, like an IDS [Intrusion Detection
System]).  Polyphemus finally has to let the sheep out to graze -- it's
a mission-critical function -- and Odysseus and his men then escape by
masquerading as legitimate traffic (sheep).

Both countries have been slaves to Kruppism and Zabernism--because
they were sovereign and free! So it will always be. So long as

The scepticism that I advocate amounts only to this: (1) that when the
experts are agreed, the opposite opinion cannot be held to be certain;
(2) that when they are not agreed, no opinion can be regarded as
certain by a non-expert; and (3) that when they all hold that no
sufficient grounds for a positive opinion exist, the ordinary man
would do well to suspend his judgment.

For all our conceits about being the center of the universe, we live

and it is very good for us to understand that.

Yes, the long war on Christianity. I pray that one day we
may live in an America where Christians can worship
freely! In broad daylight! Openly wearing the symbols of
their religion.... perhaps around their necks? And

openly Christian President. Or, perhaps, 43 of them.
Consecutively.

Cowardice asks the question, 'Is it safe?' Expediency asks the question,
'Is it politic?' Vanity asks the question, 'Is it popular?' But,

but one must take it because one's conscience tells one that it is
right.

At least one way of measuring the freedom of any society is the amount
of comedy that is permitted, and clearly a healthy society permits more
satirical comment than a repressive, so that if comedy is to function in
some way as a safety release then it must obviously deal with these
taboo areas. This is part of the responsibility we accord our licensed
jesters, that nothing be excused the searching light of comedy. If
anything can survive the probe of humour it is clearly of value, and
conversely all groups who claim immunity from laughter are claiming
special privileges which should not be granted.
